# Happiness and Socioeconomics Analysis

## Overview
This study investigates the relationship between happiness and socioeconomic factors in 93 countries using exploratory data analysis, principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and multivariate linear regression.

## Abstract
We analyze how government effectiveness, rule of law, tax revenue, and urban population percentage positively correlate with happiness, while inflation, unemployment, GDP growth, and total population size negatively correlate. Data sources include the United Nations, World Bank, and World Happiness Report.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
- **Sources**: United Nations, World Bank, World Happiness Report
- **Indicators**: GDP, Inflation, Unemployment, Tax Revenue, Rule of Law, Urban Population, Control of Corruption, Government Effectiveness, Total Population, Human Development Index (HDI), Happiness Index (HI)

### Modeling Methods
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensional reduction to reveal relationships.
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**: Quantifies correlation between happiness and socioeconomic indicators.
- **Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR)**: Describes the linear relationship between happiness and socioeconomic factors.

## Empirical Results
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized happiness and socioeconomic indicators across continents.
- Identified correlations between happiness indices (HI and HDI) and socioeconomic factors.

### Principal Component Analysis
- First principal component explains nearly half of the total variance.
- Positive correlation: Government effectiveness, rule of law, tax revenue, urban population.
- Negative correlation: GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, total population size.

### Canonical Correlation Analysis
- Confirms PCA results, with an exception for control of corruption, showing opposite association.

### Multivariate Linear Regression
- Validates PCA and CCA findings.
- Significant positive correlation: Government effectiveness, urban population.
- Significant negative correlation: GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, total population size.

## Conclusions & Policy Recommendations
- **Conclusions**: Government effectiveness, rule of law, tax revenue, urban population positively influence happiness. Inflation, unemployment, GDP growth, total population negatively impact happiness.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Strengthen rule of law, manage population size, and stabilize financial markets.
